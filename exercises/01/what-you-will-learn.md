## Learning Outcomes in Angular

After following the instructions outlined in your list for building an Angular application that interacts with the StarWarz API, someone can learn the following key concepts and skills in Angular:

1. **Angular Project Setup:**

   - Learn how to set up a new Angular project from scratch.

2. **Angular Component Development:**

   - Understand how to create Angular components to build different parts of the application, such as the table and detail page.

3. **HTTP Requests and API Integration:**

   - Gain experience in making HTTP requests to external APIs using Angular's HttpClient module.
   - Learn how to pass API keys and handle API responses.

4. **Data Binding and Display:**

   - Explore data binding in Angular to dynamically display Star Wars character information in a table.
   - Understand how to present data in a structured and user-friendly way.

5. **Routing and Navigation:**

   - Learn how to set up and configure Angular routing to navigate between different views (e.g., the table and detail page).

6. **Component Communication:**

   - Understand how to pass data between components, such as from the table to the detail page.

7. **Template Syntax:**

   - Get hands-on experience with Angular template syntax to display specific details of a selected character on the detail page.

8. **Angular Directives:**

   - Use Angular directives to control the structure and behavior of HTML elements in the application.

9. **Angular Services:**

   - Explore Angular services to encapsulate data-fetching logic and share data between components.

10. **Error Handling:**

    - Learn how to handle errors that may occur during API requests and provide a seamless user experience.

11. **Application Architecture:**

    - Gain insights into organizing an Angular application's structure, separating concerns, and creating modular components.

12. **Angular Best Practices:**
    - Apply best practices in Angular development, such as using services for data retrieval, using smart and dumb components, and adhering to style and coding conventions.

By completing these steps, individuals will have a practical understanding of building an Angular application, making API requests, handling data, and implementing navigation and user interfaces. This project provides a solid foundation for further exploration of advanced Angular concepts and development practices.
